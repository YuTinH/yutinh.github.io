<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a third-year graduate student majoring in Computer Science and Technology at [East China Normal University](https://www.ecnu.edu.cn/), School of Computer Science and Technology. I'm working on continual learning under the supervision of [Prof. Liang He](https://faculty.ecnu.edu.cn/_s16/hl2/main.psp) and [Prof. Jie Zhou](https://faculty.ecnu.edu.cn/_s16/zj2/main.psp). Before coming to East China Normal University, I graduated from Qufu Normal University with a bachelor's degree in software engineering. Currently, I focus on continual learning of multi-modal large language models. I have also researched domain adaptation learning, semantic segmentation, and visual question answering.

**<span style="color:red">I am seeking the collaboration of Continual Learning of LLMs. If you are also interested in Continual Learning, please feel free to communicate with me!</span>**
